To test the API, you can use tools like Postman, Insomnia, or simply make HTTP requests from your application frontend. Here's a basic guide on how to test the API using Postman:

1. **Register a User**:

   - Open Postman.
   - Set the request method to POST.
   - Set the request URL to `http://localhost:3000/auth/register`.
   - Set the request body to JSON format with an email and password:
     ```json
     {
       "email": "test@example.com",
       "password": "password123"
     }
     ```
   - Send the request. You should receive a response indicating successful registration.

2. **Login**:

   - Set the request method to POST.
   - Set the request URL to `http://localhost:3000/auth/login`.
   - Set the request body to JSON format with the registered email and password:
     ```json
     {
       "email": "test@example.com",
       "password": "password123"
     }
     ```
   - Send the request. You should receive a response containing a JWT token.

3. **Access Secure Routes**:
   - Copy the JWT token from the login response.
   - Set the request method to GET or POST.
   - Set the request URL to one of the secure routes, for example `http://localhost:3000/security/secure-connection`.
   - Add an Authorization header with the value `Bearer <token>`, replacing `<token>` with the JWT token.
   - Send the request. You should receive a response indicating successful access to the secure route.

Remember to replace `http://localhost:3000` with the appropriate URL if your server is hosted elsewhere.

Additionally, you can automate testing using tools like Mocha and Chai for writing unit tests and Supertest for making HTTP requests within the test environment. These tools can help you ensure that your API functions correctly under different scenarios and edge cases.
